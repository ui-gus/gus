GUS is to social-networking as an intranet is to the Internet.
		Where other social networks distract users with non-university
		non-local non-face-to-face non-involvement, GUS will focus these
		types of functionalities to the university and local community
		setting to best meet the administrative and service needs of groups
		in a university setting.  In addition to being a group-centered
		student-involvement web-application.

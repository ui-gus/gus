The purpose of the system under development is to provide a tool
		for the easy administration and tracking of university-style groups
		including but not limited to clubs and sports teams, the system will
		also try to increase student involvement by connecting and recognizing
		the involvement of users. While the system will be used by university
		personnel, this document is intended to be read and understood by UICS
		software designers and coders.  This document will also be approved by
		Dr. Clinton Jeffery.

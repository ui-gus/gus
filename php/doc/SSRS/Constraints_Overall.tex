		GUS must meet privacy policies as they apply to both the
		University of Idaho and social networking sites.  GUS must be
		able to interface with outside database servers (such as the
		Center for Volunteerism's database, UI's career seeker site,
		common social networks, and parent groups of university groups).
		Member's activities and group's activities must be audited for
		accuracy and safety.  The languages used to program GUS will be
		primarily, HTML, CSS, and PHP for the user interface, C++ for
		the interface between the user interface (which will implement
		security and complex business rules), and the database, and
		SQL for the database.  The networking protocols will be TCP/IP
		and Open MP / MPI will be used to enhance parallel operation.
		The system will have personal information for over 5,000
		students, so confidentiality is of the utmost importance.

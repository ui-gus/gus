		\subsection{Environmental Constraints}
At this time, there are no reasonable Environmental Constraints native to GUS other than a working computer, electricity, and a bit of privacy.
		\subsection{System Requirement Constraints}
Since G.U.S. is a web-based product, all significant system requirements will be shifted away from the client-side and onto the server. All the client will need to properly utilize GUS is a modern web browser. So far, GUS proven to be compatible with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item FireFox 3.0 (or higher)
	\item Internet Explorer 7.0 (or higher)
	\item Google Chrome (any version)
	\item Safari 5 (or higher)
\end}itemize} 
In short, any user who's system can adequately run any of the above applications will be able to utlize GUS.
		\subsection{User Characteristic Constraints}
GUS carries with it the inherent danger of private data loss; just like every other online application that deals with private information. As such, any user who uses the system must be aware of the security risks associated with doing so. To ensure that our clients understand this, GUS will notify new users of these risks during registration.
